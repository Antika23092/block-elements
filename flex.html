The method begins by cutting down the trees and woody plants in an area. </p></div>
        <div class="col3"><h3 style="text-align: center;">3.</h3><p>The downed vegetation, or "slash", is then left to dry, usually right before the rainiest part of the year. Then, the biomass is burned, resulting in a nutrient-rich layer of ash which makes the soil fertile, as well as temporarily eliminating weed and pest species. </p></div>
